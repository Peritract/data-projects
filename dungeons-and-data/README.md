# Dungeons and Data

This notebook focuses on accessing the [Dungeons & Dragons (Fifth Edition) API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) and exploring the different types of monsters in the game.

I wrote about this project on [Dev.to]().

## Motivation

I created this project for three reasons:

1. As part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

2. To explore an unfamiliar API

3. To practice data exploration and unsupervised learning techniques

## Questions

The project focused on two main questions:

1. Are there neglected monster niches?
People create "homebrew" D&D content all of the time, developing new quests and classes and monsters to put in their games. If there are particular kinds or styles of monster that are relatively uncommon, it could be useful to identify them, so that people creating new content can target the most untrodden ground.

2. Are the raw stats (such as strength and charisma) strongly linked to challenge rating (a monster's canonical difficulty to overcome)?
Challenge rating seems - from an outside perspective - to be a bit of an arbitrary figure. Having some idea of how closely challenge rating is linked to monster stats could help people planning D&D games to balance them more effectively.

## Data Source

The data for this project was pulled from the Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition API. It's a really great API to work with - the documentation is very clear, and there are no fiddly authorisation problems.

The dataset used consisted of details on 322 monsters.

## Libraries used

The following libraries were used to complete this project:

- Pandas
- Requests
- Collections
- Textwrap
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn

## Files involved

- All coded written during this project is stored in the [notebook file](./Dungeons%20and%20Data.ipynb)
